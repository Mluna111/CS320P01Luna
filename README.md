<h1>Timing Loops for Asymptotic Analysiis</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This code tests one loop at a time. The user chooses the loop to test. Then, chooses the
set of Ns , number of times to loop, used to show the asymptotic growth. Each N in the set of Ns are timed a MaxNumTrails,
a number of trials. These times will be averaged giving a timing value for each N and writen to a file and standard output.
